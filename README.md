Dummy repository to trigger GitHub webhook events

Hii I am Akhila
This project is a simple GitHub webhook listener.
I created this with MongoDB and flask. The main purpose of this project is to watch a GitHub repository for events like push, pull or merge and show them on webpage in real time and python is used as backend and MongoDB atlas to store data in cloud and in order to access my local server, I used ngrok.
